Project: Make a ping pong game out of LED's.  
The game will simulate a ping pong game with the LED bouncing back and fourth.  The led will move faster as the game progresses and a player gets a point when the opposing player fails to press the button (paddle) in time.  

Need: Wires
Rasperry Pi
Monitor 
HDMI 
Box for LED's to sit in
Keyboard
Software for rasp pi that can output to LED's
